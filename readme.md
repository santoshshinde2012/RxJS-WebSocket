# RxJS-WebSocket

Basic demo for RxJS and WebSocket in Angular and Node JS

# Uses

* RxJS(rxjs)
* WebSocket(ws)
* Angular CLI
* Typescript

### Cloning The GitHub Repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/santoshshinde2012/RxJS-WebSocket.git
```

## Quick Install

Once you've downloaded the demo and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your demo application.

The demo comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` file that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies in client and server, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Server Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 8999 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:8999/](http://localhost:8999/)


## Running Your Client Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 4200 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

Try to open same URL [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in two or more browser windows and play with the broadcast button.
